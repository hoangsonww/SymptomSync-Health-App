# Jenkins Notes

- `Jenkinsfile` mirrors GitHub Actions but adds image signing, CDK deployment, and progressive delivery steps.
- If build, test, or deploy commands change here, inspect `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and `jenkins/README.md` too.

## Skills

- Use `$symptomsync-release-change` for CI/CD work.
