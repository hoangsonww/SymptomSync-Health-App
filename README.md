```

- **Supabase**: The backend is powered by Supabase, which provides a Postgres database, authentication, and real-time capabilities.
  - Each table is protected by **Row Level Security (RLS)** policies to ensure user data isolation, so that users can only access/update/delete their own data.
- **Realtime Broadcast**: Any create/update/delete triggers both a `postgres_changes` subscription and a broadcast message so all open clients show a toast notification.
- **Cron Jobs**: Scheduled jobs (via Supabase Cron) that scan upcoming reminders and dispatch notifications every second.
- **Postgres Triggers**: Database triggers that listen for changes in the `medication_reminders`, `appointment_reminders`, and `health_logs` tables, and send messages to the broadcast channel.
  - There is also a trigger on the `auth.users` table to create a corresponding `user_profiles` entry when a new user signs up.
- **AI Chatbot**: The chatbot uses the Google AI API to analyze user symptoms and provide health insights.

## Installation

1. Clone the repo

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/comp426-25s/final-project-team-16.git
   cd final-project-team-16
   ```

2. Install dependencies (Remember to use `--legacy-peer-deps` if you encounter issues with React versions being incompatible with Shadcn/ui)
   ```bash
   npm install --legacy-peer-deps
   ```
3. Copy `.env.example` → `.env.local` and fill in your Supabase credentials
   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=…
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=…
   NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY=…
   ```
4. Run the dev server
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

---

## Configuration

- **Supabase**
  - Configure **Auth** settings in the Supabase dashboard
    - Enable email/password signups
    - Uncheck the confirmation email option for now
  - Create tables: `user_profiles`, `medication_reminders`, `appointment_reminders`, `health_logs`, `files`, and `user_notifications` and enable Realtime for all of them.
    - Set relationships between tables using Foreign Keys.
  - Add RLS policies for user isolation to the tables. All tables should have the following policies or similar:
    - `select`: `auth.uid() = user_profile_id`
    - `insert`: `auth.uid() = user_profile_id`
    - `update`: `auth.uid() = user_profile_id`
    - `delete`: `auth.uid() = user_profile_id`
  - Set up **Cron** jobs to run `send_reminders()` stored procedure daily/hourly or even every second.
    - To do so, you might need to enable the `pg_cron` extension in your Supabase project.
  - Create **Postgres Functions** to handle the logic for sending notifications and reminders
    - `send_reminders()`: Check for upcoming reminders and send notifications
    - `create_user_profile()`: Create a new user profile when a user signs up
  - Define **Database Triggers** to write to broadcast channels on insert/update/delete and to create a new user profile on signup
  - Set up **Storage** for file uploads. Create 2 buckets: `avatars` and `documents`

- **Environment**
  - `.env.local` holds all keys (refer to `.env.example`)
  - Default port: `3000`

4. Navigate to **Calendar** to see a month/week/day/agenda view of all events, add events, or even import/export ICS.
5. All changes sync in real‑time across open tabs/devices; cron‑driven reminders notify you via in-app notifications.
6. Use the **Documents** page to upload/export health records, prescriptions, etc.
7. Chat with the **AI Chatbot** for symptom analysis and health insights.
8. Toggle between light and dark mode for better accessibility.
9. View and manage your **profile**. You can also vies other users' profiles.
